# ShowFlow-UI-Action
ServiceNow UI Action to open current records Flow Designer context in operations view

Update set contains to two components:
  1. FlowDesignerUtils – Global script include
  2. Show Flow Context – UI Action .. note: it uses task as the table.  If you have a table that is not task or extended from task you’ll need to create the same UI Action for that table.
